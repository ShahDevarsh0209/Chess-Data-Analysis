Decoding Chess: Analysis of 20,000 games

Our project explores the game of chess in an effort to identify the underlying patterns, strategies, and variables that have an impact on a game's result. Our project attempts to provide useful insights into winning strategies for both the white and black pieces, while also examining the relationship between particular chess openings and game outcomes, with an emphasis on meeting the needs of casual and beginner-level chess players.
